Some of my researches, reports and papers
## [Renewable Energy Report](https://github.com/Abdullrahmen/Papers/blob/main/Renewable%20Energy%20v1.8.pdf)
While studying at the engineering college, I authored this comprehensive report on Renewable Energy, detailing its various types in accordance with standard research and reporting guidelines.
## [GridGuard Masters - 11th Engineering Mathematics Research Day](https://github.com/Abdullrahmen/Papers/blob/main/Smart%20Grid%20-%20GridGuard%20v1.7.pdf) [(Github repository)](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Alazhary/GridGuard-Masters)
This project is a machine learning-based system that addresses the challenge of accurately predicting electrical loads, helping energy providers and facility managers: Improve load forecasting accuracy: Reduce energy waste and optimize grid management by predicting upcoming electrical loads for days, months, or even years. Data-driven load insights: Gain valuable insights into future energy requirements through accurate predictions. Interactive visualization: Explore predicted load curves through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

Our Main research also covers algorithm applications on smart and classic grids and implements basic decision-making features.
